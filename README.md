###What's it written in?###
 - The data collection will be written in node.js
 - The searching will be written with pure htm + css + javascript, with jquery to fetch data either locally, or form a node.js server

###Installing / Using###
 - CD to the project dir and `npm install`, this will install all the required dependencies
 - Parse app.js into node.js (Run `Run Me.bat`)

###Project Goals###
 - Allow you to filter all rooms in the university to find one with your requirements (eg: A projector and a microphone)
 - Allow you to refine that search to rooms which aren't booked during certain hours (eg: 3:00 - 5:00 on a Friday)
 - Allow you to further refine your search based on how far away from your current location (likely a grid reference) the rooms are
